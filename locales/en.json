    "text": "Since I was young, I've always been driven by <strong>curiosity</strong> and the desire to understand how things work. When I got my first <strong>computer</strong>, I discovered a universe of possibilities and realized I could <strong>create</strong> what I had only imagined before. In 2020, during the pandemic, I rediscovered <strong>programming</strong> through <strong>Gustavo Guanabara's</strong> <strong>video course</strong> and fell in love with the field. Since then, I've been studying <strong>technology</strong>, exploring new <strong>languages</strong>, <strong>frameworks</strong>, and concepts of <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. Today, I focus on <strong>web development</strong> with <strong class=\"hover:text-[#42b883] duration-300 transition-all ease-in\">Vue</strong> and <strong class=\"hover:text-[#f53003] duration-300 transition-all ease-in\">Laravel</strong>, creating functional and well-structured applications. At <strong class=\"hover:text-[#8a0538] duration-300 transition-all ease-in\">PUC-PR</strong>, I have the opportunity to transform <strong>ideas</strong> into <strong>real</strong> projects, integrating <strong>innovation</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>data analysis</strong> to develop impactful solutions."

In addition to the visual layer, I also work on implementing backend functionalities, especially in the processes of inserting and querying sensitive data, ensuring compliance with legal and operational requirements. One of the main challenges of the project is ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), given the volume and sensitivity of the information handled, balancing security, <strong>performance</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong>. I have contributed to the technical evolution of the system with a focus on <strong>scalability</strong>, code clarity, and organization of reusable components in the <strong>frontend</strong>, in addition to secure integration with the database.",

      "description": "I worked on developing the company's main <strong>accounting</strong> platform, participating from the <strong>choice of technologies</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong> to the definition of the visual identity and component structure. This was my first experience leading a larger-scale project technically, which gave me a broader view of software architecture and requirements management. The system was developed with <strong>Vue 3</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, focusing on dynamism and adaptation to different tax and fiscal rules according to state and user profile, making the experience more intuitive and efficient. I also implemented automated tests with <strong>Vitest</strong>, ensuring the reliability of critical modules, especially in the reports generated by the platform. In addition to this project, I also collaborated on developing <strong>TimeSheet</strong>, an internal time tracking system, where employees recorded their working hours and linked their activities to respective clients. This project was developed with Vue 3 and Bootstrap and required special attention to precision in time handling and correct calculation for billing purposes. Working with this type of data brought important technical <strong>challenges</strong>, especially related to consistency and integrity of information in real-time. This experience allowed me to work on multiple <strong>projects</strong> in parallel, improve my technical organization, enhance my communication with other company departments, and deepen my knowledge about complex business rules.",

The study highlights the importance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with methods like LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM, which make models more understandable and auditable. It also addresses the ethical and legal impact of algorithmic opacity, arguing that the AI of the future must be understandable, responsible, and human-centered, balancing technical performance and moral clarity.",
